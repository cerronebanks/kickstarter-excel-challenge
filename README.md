# kickstarter-excel-challenge

Purpose of this analysis is to derermine how different campaigns compared in relation to launch dates & goals.

Some of the challenges I encountered were with =countifs formula calculating correctly & I spent a lot of time using available resources to understand the gap. the canceled & failed columns I was unable to get to operate correctly. 

What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes based on Launch Date? The most successful capmaigns occur between June - August. 1st & 4th quarter of the year are traditonally less likely to produce successfull theter campaigns.

What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? Campaigns with Goals less than $5,000 goal will generally do better, specifically in the summer time. the lower the goal the higher probability of success. 

What are some limitations of this dataset? years in too wide of range to plot data.

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? multiple charts could have been used to tell the story of this data. column & waterfall graphs to show the year & growth of each play type.
